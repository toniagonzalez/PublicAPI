# PublicAPI

I built this project with provided skeletal HTML and basic CSS styling. I added additional styling for font and background coloring. I also made media adjustments for text layout on 320px mobile layout.

Using a Fetch request I requested a JSON object from (https://randomuser.me/) to obtain the information for 12 employees which included with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.

With Object Oriented JS I parsed the data and dynamically added interactivity to the site including a search bar and a modal window that provides detailed information, such as the employeeâ€™s birthday and address. I also made some additions for W3C Accessibility Guidelines surrounding input elements, added US State abbreviations, and converted the birthday format with JS.
